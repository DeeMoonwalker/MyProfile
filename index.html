        <p>  <strong>1) What is your interest in IT?</strong> <br>
<br>
        Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Quantum Computing. Those fields are fascinating, almost magical (quantum tunnelling and entanglement is like something straight out of an Alice in Wonderland book). These technologies will completely revolutionise the world. Imagine an AI superintelligence that is smarter than all the humans that ever existed. What will AI be capable of? Will Earth transform into a paradise where humans are free of disease, pollution and poverty? A peaceful world is a possibility. Much like the development of classical computers, where the offshoot technologies of mobile phones and laptops were not predicated, it is hard to know what technologies will be developed from quantum and AI research.
        
        <br> 
        <br>
        
        <strong>2) When did your interest in IT start?</strong> <br>
        <br>
        
        I’ve loved computers all my life. They have dramatically improved our world. A world without computers is foreign to me. Out of curiosity I learnt about Alan Turning, Tim Berners-Lee, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniack, Steve Jobs, Vint Cerf and Robert Khan, but I never learnt about the hardware or software! But recently, I began reading about the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Quantum Computing. I've always loved quantum science because I'm curious to know how reality works. These new technologies have motivated me to understand computer science and mathematics. Scientists are creating things that were once only science fiction. It’s an incredible time to be alive. 

        <br>
        <br>
        
        <strong>3) Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</strong> <br>
        <br>

        It’s a cumulation of events. I am currently undertaking a Certificate 2 in Electrotechnology and learning all about circuits and electricity. I thought about becoming an electrical engineer or electrician. My teacher told me to study programming because the emergence of the Internet of Things will make it necessary. I also read and watched a lot of books and documentaries related to computers. Here’s a list of my favourites:
        
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>1)</strong>	The Elegant Universe by Brian Green<br> 
        <strong>2)</strong>	Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark<br>
       <strong>3)</strong>	Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom<br>
       <strong>4)</strong>  Programming the Universe by Seth Lloyd<br>
        <strong>5)</strong> Our Mathematical Universe by Max Tegmark<br>
        <strong>6)</strong> Ghost in The Wires by Kevin Mitnick<br>
        <strong>7)</strong> Digital Fortress by Dan Brown <br>
        <strong>8)</strong> Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton<br>
         
        <br>
        We have well and truly entered the computer age. Over the last 20 years there have been many break-throughs in technology and the future looks bright. I hope I’m alive to see AI superintelligence. I believe it’s important to be computer literate, appreciate technology and use it in a safe and appropriate manner.

        <br>
        <br>

        
        <strong>4) Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong> <br>
        <br>
        RMIT is one of the best universities in Australia to study computers and engineering. My sister studied Civil Engineering at RMIT and many friends are RMIT graduates. RMIT has a great reputation for high quality education throughout the world and their facilities are modern and outstanding. RMIT is working with ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology as well. RMIT offers a computer science course completely online and their platform is easy to navigate.

        <br>
        <br>
        
        <strong>5) What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong>
         <br>
        <br>

        I’d like to learn as much as I can about computer science. I want to have a deep understanding of the following: Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, computer hardware, robotics, artificial intelligence, data science, mathematics, machine learning, quantum computers, logical thinking, leadership and teamwork skills. I’m particularly interested in gaining knowledge on AI and quantum computers. I’d also like gain practical experience in these fields.

      <h5>MOTIVATION</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">
        <u>  <strong>Maths fluency is lacking in employed people</strong></u><br><br>
        Maths is a language, like English, so why do even well-educated people have problems understanding and speaking it? According to data from ‘Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)’ employed persons aged 15 to 64 years who worked in 'Professional, Scientific and Technical Services' had numeracy skills that were high (70% at Level 3 or above), but those working in Construction, Administration and Manufacturing were low (44%, 39% and 42% at Level 3 or above respectively).
          <br>
          <br>
          
                                                                       
    
          Numeracy levels among the general Australian population (both employed and unemployed), were low. Close to 6.5% (1.1 million) of Australians had numeracy skills at Below Level 1, 15% (2.5 million) at Level 1, 32% (5.4 million) at Level 2, 31% (5.2 million) at Level 3, 11% (1.8 million) at Level 4 and 1.4% (230,000) at Level 5.<br><br>

    Know more maths, make more money:
People with higher scores in numeracy made more money from wages and salaries. Of people employed full time who were in the highest income group, 81% had a numeracy Level 3 or above, compared to 29% of people in the lowest income group
Costs of innumeracy:
And what are the costs of innumeracy? The inability to rationally understand statistics, large numbers, graphs and probabilities has resulted in a population that can be easily manipulated and misinformed in areas of great importance - governmental policies, personal life decisions, medicine, technology, education, agriculture and finance. Pseudoscience and conspiracy theories are rising and the recent Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted this well. It is more crucial than now than ever to possess a clear, logical way of looking at the world.

I am an Advocate Personality INFJ-A: 
Advocates are likely to find that most corporate career paths are not designed for them, but for those focused on their status and material gain. However, people with this personality are able to find work that suits them in just about any field. Advocate personalities need to find meaning in their work and to know that they are helping and connecting with people. <br>

<strong> The results of Honey & Mumford learning style test:</strong> <br>
                           <br>
My Primary Learning style is a equal mixture of Pragmatic/Theorist/Reflector: 
Pragmatists need to be able to see how to put the learning into practice in the real world. Pragmatists are likely to be experimenters, trying out new ideas, theories and techniques to see if they work. Learning methods especially suited to pragmatists include: Practicals, Case studies, Problem setting and Discussions.
Theorists like to think through problems in a logical manner. They value rationality and objectivity, and like to assimilate disparate facts into coherent theories. They are disciplined, aiming to fit things into a rational order. Learning methods especially suited to theorists include: Models, Classroom response systems, Story-telling, Quotes.
                           <br>
                           <br>
Reflectors prefer to stand back and observe. They tend to be cautious, preferring to take a back seat. They like to collect and analyse information to help them reach their conclusions, which they may take considerable time and effort to develop. Reflectors see the big picture by using information gathered from previous experience as well as the here and now. Learning methods especially suited to reflectors include: Paired discussions, Self-analysis questionnaire, Demonstrations, Coaching.

<strong>The results for Helen Fisher’s neuro-chemical based personality test:</strong> <br>
<br>
My primary personality type is Director (Testosterone dominant brain system):
DIRECTORS shoot for the stars. These men (and women) express traits linked with the testosterone system in the brain. They tend to excel at analytical and strategic thinking. They are also direct, decisive, exacting and tough minded. Directors are good at what scientists call “rule-based systems,” aptitudes such as higher math, mechanics, computers, engineering and/or music. And they are often competitive, as well as skeptical and emotionally contained. 
                           <br>
                           <br>
My secondary personality type is Builder (Serotonin dominant brain system):
BUILDERS are pillars of society. Most likely highly expressive of the serotonin system in the brain, they are traditional and conventional, as well as cautious, calm and often social. These men and women like to build networks; community and family are important to them. They make good managers because they are orderly, conscientious, thorough and loyal. And they respect rules and like schedules. Builders seek a stable and predictable team player, someone who shares their fidelity to family and tradition
